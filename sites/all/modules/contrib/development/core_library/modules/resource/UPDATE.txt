Resource Handling Update
========================

If you are updating from a development or an alpha version, please clear your
module and core cache. Core won't do it by itself because we don't have any
update functions.

This is necessary for the autoloader to find defined classes. If you don't
you will get a lot of 404 errors (but no WSOD).
